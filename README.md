# Solar-System

This Python program creates a visual animation of the solar system using Tkinter. It displays the Sun at the center with eight planets orbiting around it on predefined paths. Each planet, represented by a colored circle, moves at its unique speed, simulating real-life orbital motion. The continuous loop of the animation offers a dynamic and simplified representation of the planets revolving around the Sun, making it an engaging educational tool for demonstrating basic concepts of planetary motion and the solar system's structure.
